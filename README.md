# Covid-19_and-Mobility_USA


Executive Summary

Everyday tons of data being created about COVID-19 and with the seriousness of this pandemic have become obvious, passionate data analysts and scientists speed the paces to understand the cause and avoid the spread. Besides, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have provided the latest results on the impact of COVID-19 over the past few months. Furthermore, Google Maps provides the dataset on COVID-19 community mobility to help health officials make critical decisions on fighting the spread of COVID-19.

Motivation

In any outbreak all governments start responding in the best way to prevent the spread of disease. For the current COVID-19, WHO AND CDC have announced the main spread is through person-to-person contact, and because of that, governments in the united states decided to apply restrictions on states and community mobility. In response to policies, places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential have witnessed a decrease in people. Furthermore, governments have made testing across all states available. In general, the effort to fight this pandemic has slowed the spread of COVID-19, but in the united states we saw COVID-19 cases have increased rapidly along with its death toll also raised. I decided to look at these datasets to visualize and gather informative insights on the spread of COVID-19 after the testing became available and restrictions applied on state mobility.

Data Question

The aim here is to study the fatality trend, cases increase compared to the number of testing, and to answer the two questions: have testing and mobility restrictions helped to slow the spread of COVID-19?  which kind of mobility has decreased the most?

Known Issues and Challenges

Challenges include:

•	Pulling the datasets from different sources.

•	Using jupyter notebook to read, split, clean,  
    convert, and merge the data into one data frame.

•	EDA on the dataset.

•	Using power bi to create a data visualization.
